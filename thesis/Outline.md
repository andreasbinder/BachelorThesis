## Abstract

## Introduction

- AI, Snake-like Robots, RL (Go etc), Structure

## Theoretical Background

### Reinforcement Learning + Markov Decision Process
- Markov Property
- Characteristics
- value function approximation
- ? policy gradient, actor-critic

### Inverse Reinforcement Learning
- Konzept/ intuition
- advantages of IRL
- apprenticeship learning
- difference to Imitation learning (Bsp BC)
